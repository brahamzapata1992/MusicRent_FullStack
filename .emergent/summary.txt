<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user has an e-commerce application for renting musical instruments built with React. The initial requests are:
1.  Make it easy to change the API URL for deployment, so it's a simple matter of changing a single variable.
2.  Fix any existing defects.
3.  Improve the design and styles, but without losing the original design's essence.
4.  Add loading placeholders for cards and images when data is being fetched.
5.  Improve the product detail page.
6.  Ensure the entire application is responsive and looks good on mobile devices, paying special attention to the header and dropdown menus.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
This is a React + Vite frontend application for an e-commerce site. The codebase was refactored to centralize all API calls. Previously, the API endpoint  was hardcoded in over 30 places. Now, all API calls use a centralized configuration from , which reads the URL from a  variable in the  file.

Basic UI/UX improvements have been implemented:
-   Loading skeletons for product cards ().
-   Image placeholders on the product detail page.
-   A critical bug in a  template literal within  has been fixed.
-   The  has been updated with instructions on how to set the API URL.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the middle of implementing mobile responsiveness across the application. It was editing several CSS files (, , , ) to add media queries and adjust layouts for smaller screens.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent to verify the UI on different screen sizes, or the screenshot tool to visually inspect the mobile layout.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) Complete and verify mobile responsiveness improvements.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Complete mobile responsiveness**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started adding media queries to several CSS files (, , , etc.) but did not complete or test the full implementation.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review all recent CSS changes made for responsiveness.
        2.  Use the browser's developer tools or the screenshot tool to test the layout on various mobile viewports (e.g., iPhone, Pixel).
        3.  Specifically check the , product grid (), search dropdowns (), and product detail page ().
        4.  Fix any layout, overflow, or alignment issues found.
